### General Info
***
A very simple booking management for my hotel in Gran Canaria. \
Is under construction but I put all my energy into it.

This proyect can run with my backend here: \
[Backend](https://github.com/TeteV/CRUDLumen)

## Data Model

In database have the following tables, \
Users Have: Id, Dni, Name (Complete), email, password(codified), api_token, url_img(Thumbnail)
Rooms Have: num (Room Number), num_ppl (Numbers of people can stay), size, avaible,url_img(Photos of the room), user_Id(FK)\
Booking Have: Check-in, Check-out, Diet, num_room(FK), user_id(FK)

### RelationShips

### Use Case

A non Reg Person can only see the available rooms.
A registered person can see available rooms and book it.

## Appearance

### Usability
##### First of all
You must to create your user in Sig-In window.

![Image text](https://github.com/TeteV/AuthKotlin/blob/master/img/signinchustra.JPG)

Then you can login in Log-In window and you see something like this

![Image text](https://github.com/TeteV/AuthKotlin/blob/master/img/succlog.JPG)

Then you can insert your preferences, in this case I will go alone

This is the list of all rooms and you can take your favourite, with images
though is an iguana, I like this room.

I pick this iguana's room and it show me the diet I want and the details of the room and the book button to rent and have a nice weekend

and show your info

### Why Kotlin?
***
Kotlin is a new modern language based in Java. Developed by JetBrains 

This formal language is statically typed and can be used on servers, on websites and in the Apple operating system (iOS)

Enables mixed projects by mixing Java code with Kotlin code.


Fundamentally it has object-oriented constructions also allows simple and more complex function constructions and can mix elements of both styles

In android studio you can check your proyect in differents Hosts 

##### Advantage
* Coding in Kotlin is very short, concise, and straightforward. Same work with fewer lines of code than in Java
* Higher order functions, are those that take a function as an argument and return type
* Backed by JetBrains, Google, and Spring Framework

##### Disadvantages
* Longer execution time
* The code becomes a bit difficult to read and understand at first
* Small Support Community
